            CoFaWo is a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing the
            incidence of food poisoning on university campuses in Nigeria. We
            believe that everyone has the right to safe food, and we are
            committed to working with students, staff, and the university
            community to make our campuses safer.
            <br /> We achieve our mission through a variety of activities,
            including: <br />• Collecting data on food poisoning: We collect
            data on food poisoning on university campuses through our website.
            This data helps us to understand the scope of the problem and to
            identify areas where we can make a difference. <br />• Raising
            awareness of food safety: We raise awareness of food safety through
            our website, our social media channels, and our educational
            materials. We believe that everyone has a role to play in preventing
            food poisoning, and we want to equip people with the knowledge they
            need to keep themselves and their loved ones safe.
            <br /> • Advocating for food safety: We advocate for food safety
            with the university administration, food vendors, and government
            agencies. We believe that everyone has a responsibility to ensure
            that safe food is available to everyone, and we will continue to
            work until our campuses are free from food poisoning.
