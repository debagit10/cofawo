          There are many ways you can get involved with CoFaWo. You can:
          <br /> • Report a case of food poisoning: If you think you have food
          poisoning, please report it to us through our website or our social
          media channels. Your report will help us to collect data on the
          problem and to identify areas where we can make a difference.
          <br /> • Share your story: If you have had a personal experience with
          food poisoning, please share your story with us. Your story can help
          to raise awareness of the problem and to encourage others to take
          action.
          <br /> • Volunteer your time: We are always looking for volunteers to
          help us with our work. If you are interested in volunteering, please
          contact us. <br />• Donate to our cause: Your donation will help us to
          continue our work to reduce the incidence of food poisoning on
          university campuses.
          <br /> We appreciate your support in our fight against food poisoning.
          Together, we can make our campuses safer for everyone.
