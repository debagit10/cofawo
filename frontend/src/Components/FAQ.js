                There are many different types of food poisoning, each caused by
                a different type of germ. Some of the most common types of food
                poisoning include:
                <br /> a. Salmonella: This is a bacterial infection that can
                cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. <br />
                b. Campylobacter: This is another bacterial infection that can
                cause similar symptoms to salmonella. <br />
                c. Listeria: This is a bacterial infection that can be
                especially dangerous for pregnant women and newborns. It can
                cause miscarriage, stillbirth, and serious illness in newborns.
                <br />
                d. E. coli: This is a bacterial infection that can cause a
                variety of symptoms, including bloody diarrhea, kidney failure,
                and death.
                <br /> e. Norovirus: This is a viral infection that can cause
                nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps.

                There are a number of reasons why food poisoning is so common in
                Nigeria. These include:
                <br /> a. Lack of sanitation: Many Nigerians do not have access
                to clean water or sanitation facilities. This can lead to the
                spread of germs that cause food poisoning.
                <br /> b. Poor food handling practices: Many food handlers in
                Nigeria do not have the proper training in food safety. This can
                lead to cross-contamination and the spread of germs.
                <br /> c. Inadequate food inspection: The Nigerian government
                does not have the resources to adequately inspect food
                establishments. This can lead to the sale of contaminated food.
